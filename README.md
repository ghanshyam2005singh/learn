# AlphaOneLabs Education Platform

## Project Overview

Alpha One Labs is an education platform designed to facilitate both learning and teaching. The platform provides a comprehensive environment where educators can create and manage courses, while students can learn, collaborate, and engage with peers. With features like study groups, peer connections, and discussion forums, we aim to create a collaborative learning environment that goes beyond traditional online education.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: HTML,Tailwind CSS 
- Backend: Python (Cloudflare Worker)
- Database: Cloudflare D1 (SQLite)

## Set Up Instructions

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:
 - Node.js
 - Wrangler CLI

Install Python dependencies (used by Cloudflare Python Worker packaging):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install Wrangler:

```bash
npm install -g wrangler
```

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alphaonelabs/learn.git
cd learn
```

### Login to Cloudflare (One time)

```bash
wrangler login
```

### Setup Database (D1)

- Create Database:

```bash
wrangler d1 create education_db
```

- Add the generated database_id to your wrangler.toml:

```toml
[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DB"
database_name = "education_db"
database_id = "YOUR_DATABASE_ID"
```

- Apply Schema:

```bash
wrangler d1 execute education_db --file=schema.sql
```

### Setup Environment Variables

This project requires environment variables for encryption and authentication.

- For Local Development

Create a `.dev.vars` file in the project root:

```
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-dev-encryption-key
JWT_SECRET=your-dev-jwt-secret
SENTRY_DSN=your-sentry-dsn
```

- For Production
Use Wrangler secrets:

```bash
wrangler secret put ENCRYPTION_KEY
wrangler secret put JWT_SECRET
wrangler secret put SENTRY_DSN
```

Or upload all values from an env file after verifying the active Cloudflare account:

```bash
./scripts/upload-vars.sh .env.production --account-id YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID
```

To run with no arguments, add your account ID to `.env.production`:

```
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID
```

Then run:

```bash
./scripts/upload-vars.sh
```

You can also verify by account name:

```bash
./scripts/upload-vars.sh .env.production --account-name "Your Account Name"
```

Optional Sentry tuning secrets:

```bash
wrangler secret put SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE
wrangler secret put SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT
wrangler secret put SENTRY_RELEASE
```


### Run Backend

```bash
wrangler dev
```

Backend server starts at:

```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8787
```

### Run Frontend

- Open directly

```bash
public/index.html
```

- Use a local server

```bash
npx serve public
```

Frontend Server will start at:

```bash
http://localhost:3000
```
